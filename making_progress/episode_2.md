# Happiness and the Meaning of Your Life


## Survival, Progress, Meaning of Life

* Striving towards progress 
* What about Happiness?


## What is Happiness?

* Nervous system's way of directing behaviors towards evolved ancestral
  survival goals. 
* Water, food, sex, sleep, company, etc.


## Non-linear relationship with survival

* There are some things which don't directly contribute to survival 
* Music
* Art
* Drugs can activate the happiness systems, but very complex (use caution)


## Challenges with Happiness in the current environment

* Current environment is way different from the environment in which these
  mechanisms evolved
* Sometimes you can hack those systems (hack - doesn't contribute to survival)
* Like heroin addiction, overeating, porn addiction 
* Sex is very powerful, sublimely pleasure inducing (not that I would know, my
  sex is only hypothetical), but porn overconsumption doesn't lead to increased
  survival 


**Happiness systems are deeply ingrained!!!**


## Three categories of Happiness

* Happiness that is actively bad for survival
* Happiness that is neutral towards progress 
* Happiness that is good for survival and progress 


## Balancing Progress and Happiness

* Reduce happiness that are bad for the individual and the team
* Don't spill toxic chemicals into a river to induce happiness (lol wtf)
* Take or leave the neutral happiness
* Support, nurture, and enjoy things that make an individual happy and
  contribute to progress!!! (this is the biggest one)


## Things that are good for survival and progress

* Productive work (if it makes you happy)
* Cooperation with others 
* Raising a family well
* Supporting and improving physical health
* Supporting and improving mental health
* Do your best to align the origin of happiness and the stuff that's good for
  everyone else 
* Worrying makes things so much harder, so if it makes you worry too much, don't
  push it

## What can we do?

* Discourage pursuing happiness that is anti-progress
* If it's just another way to live, live and let live (it's fine to be
  different)
* Promote and encourage sources of happiness that are very much pro-progress 
* People are way more alike than they are different, so we can all strive
  towards something great :) (some hippy shit)
