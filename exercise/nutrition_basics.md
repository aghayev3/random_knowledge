# Nutrition Basics for personal training course by Dr. Mike Israetel


## You are not a nutritionist

* Please do not give nutrition advice to: 
    * The elderly
    * Pregnant women
    * Individuals with ANY disease conditions 
* However, for people who want to (insert our "goal" here):
    * It's fine to give out basic nutrition advice
    * Check legal status of advice in your area


## Why Nutrition?

* 1) Nutrition is the SINGLE biggest factor in a person's appearance (yes, more
  than training)
* 2) Weight gain or loss is mostly nutrition, some training
    * What is the variable that determines weight change? 
* 3) Without proper nutrition, your clients can stall or backpedal on the BEST
  programs


## Effects of proper nutrition

* Very small in single session
* Small in single Microcycle
* Small/moderate in single Mesocycle 
* Moderate in single Macrocycle
* PROFOUND in quadrennial or career length timespan 


## A Very Important Term

* FSR

* Fractional Synthetic Rate
    * The measured rate of muscle growth 
    * Begins to rise after training
    * Peaks in 1-2 days, falls off for 2-5 days
    * Needs new aminos to supply (from food or other muscles in the body)


## Another Important Term

* FBR

* Fractional Breakdown Rate
    * The measured rate of muscle loss
    * Rises during training, during lack of nutrients, ESP aminos
    * Will cost muscle in the long term if not supplied with exogenous aminos
      (steals from other muscles otherwise)


## Top Priorities for Body Comp Change

* 1) Calories in vs calories out
* 2) Macronutrients Amounts
* 3) Nutrient Timing
* 4) Food Composition (Pro, Carbs, Fat)
* 5) Supplements


## Mesocycle Basics

* Carbs paired to training volumes, as are calories
* Deloading requires similar nutrition to accumulation (why?)
* Fatloss: 1-2 lbs per week
    * Cut fats first
    * Cut carbs outside workout window second
    * Cut workout window carbs last, protein rarely
* Weight Gain: 1-2 lbs per week
    * Add workout window carbs first
    * Add fats second
    * Add carbs later in day on training days third


## Macrocycle Basics

* Mass:
    * Builds muscle, adds fat, increases fatigue, exhausts nutrient-sensitive
      hypertrophic processes
* Mid:
    * Retains muscle and fat, increases set-point, decreases fatigue
    * How do we implements this phase? (More in next slide)
* Cut:
    * Decreases fat, retains muscle, increases fatigue, potentiates
      nutrient-sensitive hypertrophic processes


## The Importance of Weight-Stability Phases

* AKA "mid" phases
* Cutting for too long:
    * Lowers the metabolism
    * Leads to muscle loss
    * Primes the client for a MASSIVE rebound, happens to almost all dieters 
* Every 10% BW loss or so:
    * Return to isocaloric diet for 1-2 months
    * Slowly raise calories to keep bodyweight stable
    * Return to dieting after, reach a new goal, mid again


## Tips to Remember

* 1) Mind the priorities
* 2) Keep goals realistic
* 3) Slow and steady with occasional mids
* 4) Avoid fads!!! (more on that later)
